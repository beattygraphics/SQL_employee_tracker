### Lessons Learned

After going back to finish this project I really saw the value of good namin habits.  tryiong to back to this code afetr so long was a nightmare.  I had to do a lot of renaming of variables.  I also really enjoyed the visibility that Sequel Pro provided for me as I was testing my application and my seeding.  Shout outs to my friend John Youngman for suggesting this to me.
